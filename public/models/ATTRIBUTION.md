Changes by OrganUI (2026): selected 15 meshes, grouped them into 13 structures by source concept, translated the 4.3 heart walls and pulmonary trunk by measured shifts of about 10 mm onto the matching 3.0 surfaces, triangulated faces, welded STL vertices, recentered and uniformly scaled coordinates, changed axes from Z-up to Y-up, recomputed smooth normals, assigned illustrative colors, and converted STL and OBJ to GLB. No decimation or invented anatomy.
